# Why Armsom chooses to develop RK3588-based products pin-compatible with Jetson Nano

**Introduction:**
It signified an important technical decision when armsom decided to adopt the RK3588 to develop a product pin-compatible with Jetson Nano , providing developers and manufacturers greater flexibility. This article explains why we chose RK3588 and how pin compatibility with Jetson Nano is achieved.

Jetson Nano has been a leading product in embedded computing, with powerful performance and abundant capabilities, widely welcomed by developers and manufacturers. However, armsom believes that adopting the Rockchip RK3588 to develop a Jetson Nano pin-compatible product will bring new opportunities and advantages to the field of embedded computing. 

**Background:**
Jetson Nano is an excellent embedded computing platform launched by NVIDIA, with outstanding performance in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. However, with the continuous evolution of technology, market demands for more features and greater flexibility are also growing. Therefore, our company decided to adopt the RK3588 chipset to develop an entirely new product that is pin-compatible with Jetson Nano while providing more performance and capabilities.

**Why choose RK3588:**

1. **Excellent performance:** The RK3588 chipset features Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A76 and Quad-Core Cortex-A55 , equipped with a Mali-G610 GPU. The 8-core CPU provides superb multi-core performance, 8K video codec, and dual 16M ISP processing capabilities suitable for complex computing tasks and machine learning workloads.

2. **Multifunctionality:** RK3588 supports various peripherals including multiple USB 3.0 ports, HDMI output, DP output, Ethernet, PCIe, Mipi CSI, etc., meaning it can easily meet the needs of diverse applications.

3. **AI acceleration:** The integrated NPU (neural processing unit) of RK3588 accelerates deep learning inference, making it an ideal choice for AI tasks.

4. **Low power consumption:** Compared to its performance, RK3588 has outstanding power efficiency, which is crucial for embedded devices, especially battery-powered products.
